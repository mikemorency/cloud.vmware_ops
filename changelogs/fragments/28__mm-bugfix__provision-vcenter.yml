bugfixes:
  - provision_vcenter - Changed default ISO mount point from /mnt to /tmp, since /tmp is more likely to be writable
  - >-
    provision_vcenter - Added dedicated complexity check for VM password at beginning of role. Complexity requirements
    are normally validated by the VCSA installer but the error thrown can be confusing. Update integration test to use
    proper password
  - >-
    provision_vcenter - Remove leading slashes when a user provides a datacenter/target host path to the installer.
    These values are supposed to be vcenter folder paths (e.g. /cluster01/host01) but a leading slash would break the
    VCSA installer config
