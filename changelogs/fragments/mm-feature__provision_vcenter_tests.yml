bugfixes:
  - provision_vcenter - vcenter vm names containing a string marked for no_log no longer trigger an unexpected error when checking if the vm already exists
  - provision_vcenter - the vcsa deploy config was invalid json if dhcp was used. Re-ordered the network section of the config template to fix
  - provision_vcenter - missing parameters in the validate_inputs tasks. Added them so the user will be alerted sooner if required parameters are missing

trivial:
  - added integration tests for role provision_vcenter
