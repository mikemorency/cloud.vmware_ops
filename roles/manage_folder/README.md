# Cluster settings role

A role to define cluster settings in vCenter.

## Requirements

pyvmomi < 7.0.3

In some cases, the vCLS cluster settings will fail to apply when using pyvmomi version 7.0.3 or greater. If this feature is required, using an earlier version will work.
Support for version 7.0.3 and higher is planned for the next release of community.vmware (>4.4.0), at which point this restriction will be removed.
