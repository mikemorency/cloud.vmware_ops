### Provisioning a VM
- **provision_vm_name**  (string, Required):
    - Name of the virtual machine to manage.
    - Virtual machine names in vCenter are not necessarily unique which may be problematic.
      If multiple virtual machines with the same name exist, then `provision_vm_folder` is required parameter to
      identify uniqueness of the virtual machine. You can also set `provision_vm_name_match` to control how multiple matching VM names are handled.
    - The parameter is required if the virtual machine does not already exist.
    - This parameter is case sensitive.

- **provision_vm_uuid**  (string):
    - The instance UUID of the virtual machine to manage.
    - This is required if `provision_vm_name` is not supplied.
    - Note that a supplied UUID will be ignored on virtual machine creation, as VMware creates the UUID internally.
      If virtual machine does not exist, then this parameter is ignored.

- **provision_vm_cluster** (String):
    - The name of the cluster where the virtual machine will run.

- **provision_vm_esxi_hostname** (string):
    - The ESXi hostname where the virtual machine will run. This is a required parameter if `provision_vm_cluster` is not set.
    - `provision_vm_esxi_hostname` and `provision_vm_cluster` are mutually exclusive parameters.

    - Absolute path to the folder where the VM will exist.
    - The folder should include the datacenter. A single ESXi's datacenter is `ha-datacenter`.
    - This parameter is case sensitive.
    - If multiple machines are found with same name, this parameter is used to identify uniqueness of the virtual machine.

- **provision_vm_datastore** (string):
    - Specify datastore or datastore cluster to use for the virtual machine backend storage.
    - This parameter takes precedence over the `provision_vm_disk.datastore` parameter.
    - This parameter can be used to override datastore or datastore cluster setting of the virtual machine when deploying from a template.
    - Please see the examples for more usage.
